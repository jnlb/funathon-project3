"""
Albumentations transform pipeline applied to every batch.

Order matters and is fixed: Resize → (optional augmentations) → Normalize →
ToTensorV2. Augmentations must run on raw pixel values *before* normalisation
so that the augmented pixels remain in the same statistical space the mean/std
were measured on. ToTensorV2 is the last step: it converts the HWC NumPy array
to a CHW torch tensor, the layout PyTorch's Conv2d expects.
`max_pixel_value=1.0` tells Albumentations our reflectance values are already
floats in roughly [0, 1] — without this it would assume uint8 [0, 255] and
multiply the std by 255.
